# AirBnB_clone
# AirBnB clone - The console
This project aims to deploy a simple copy of the Airbnb website into our server. By simple, it is meant that it won't implement all features of the website only the basic ones.

First step is going to be building a command interpreter that is basically the same as shell but used for a specific purpose.

# What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

# How do we start and then use it
To start the command operator what is needed to do is run the console.py executable file.
In interactive mode:

	$ ./console.py
	(hbnb) help

	Documented commands (type help <topic>):
	========================================
	EOF  help  quit

	(hbnb) 
	(hbnb) 
	(hbnb) quit
	$

In non-interactive mode:

	$ echo "help" | ./console.py
	(hbnb)

	Documented commands (type help <topic>):
	========================================
	EOF  help  quit
	(hbnb) 
	$
	$ cat test_help
	help
	$
	$ cat test_help | ./console.py
	(hbnb)

	Documented commands (type help <topic>):
	========================================
	EOF  help  quit
	(hbnb) 
	$
